## Core Message broker - Redis

1. ### What is Redis?

Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source (BSD licensed), NoSQL, in-memory key-value data
store use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.

Redis or the “Remote Dictionary Server" is a BSD licensed Open source Key-Value based NoSQL Database which can be used
for many things like caching, pub/sub workflows, Fully-fledge database work etc. Its main value proposition, the speed,
is achieved by residing in the memory. That is why Redis is known as an In-Memory database. However, being In-Memory
suggest that it is volatile. But Redis provides options to become a persistent database by writing to disk in different
ways.

Another specialty in Redis is supporting many complex data structures. Those include Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets,
Hashes, Bitmaps, HyperlogLogs, and Geospatial Indexes.

If we have a glance at the history of Redis, it was a project initiated by Salvatore Sanfilippo back in the days and was
first released on 10th May 2009. It is cross-platformed and written in ANCI C.

##### Redis supports the following features:-

- Replication
- Lua scripting
- LRU eviction of keys
- Transactions and different level of on-disk persistence
- Provides high availability using Redis Sentinel
- Automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
- Automatic failover

2. ### Why redis cache over Memcached and Redis Implementation?

Redis cache provides Snapshots, Replication, Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Geospatial support features which are
not provided by Memcached. Memcached could be preferable when caching relatively small and static data, such as HTML
code, images and small metadata sets.

Jedis is the client library in java for Redis. It is light-weight and easy to use. But, there are other popular client
libraries (i.e. lettuce and Redisson) are also available to connect with Redis which offers some unique features like
thread safety, transparent reconnection handling and async API calls.

we need to create a connection factory bean to connect to Redis client using JedisConnectionFactory. This connection
factory class comes under package “org.springframework.data.redis.connection.jedis”

```java
   @Bean
   JedisConnectionFactory jedisConnectionFactory(){
           RedisStandaloneConfiguration redisStandaloneConfiguration=new RedisStandaloneConfiguration("localhost",6379);
           return new JedisConnectionFactory(redisStandaloneConfiguration);
           }
```

Here we need to provide the Redis server configurational detail. In my case, I’m using default local configuration and
default port (i.e. 6379).

Create an instance of RedisTemplate class and pass the jedisConnectionFactory bean. RedisTemplate can be used for
querying data with a custom repository. This class is under package: org.springframework.data.redis.core.

```java
@Bean
RedisTemplate<String, User> redisTemplate(){
        RedisTemplate<String, User> redisTemplate=new RedisTemplate<>();
        redisTemplate.setConnectionFactory(jedisConnectionFactory());
        return redisTemplate;
        }
```

Here I’m using User detail to keep in the Redis cache. This class expect two type parameter

K — the Redis key type against which the template works (i.e. String)

V — the Redis value type against which the template works (i.e. User)

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class User implements Serializable {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private Long salary;

    public User(String id, String name, Long salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Long getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(Long salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

Here I’m using @Autowiring annotation to inject dependency of UserRepository.So that I can be able to access all the
methods which I’ve declared inside the UserRepository interface.

3. ### Use cases of Redis

- Caching — It provides an in-memory cache facility to decrease latency, increase the throughput of the application.
- Chat system or massaging system — It supports a pub-sub model with pattern matching.
- Gaming leaderboards — It has implemented Sorted sets to handle time-series data by using timestamps as the score.
- Session stores — It has in-memory data stores with high availability and persistence.
- Media- streaming — Redis can be used to store metadata about users’ profiles and viewing histories, authentication
  information/tokens for millions of users, and manifest files to enable CDNs to stream videos to millions of mobile and
  desktop users at a time.
- Geospatial — It is used to log location-based features such as drive distance, drive time etc.
- ML — It provides fast in-memory data store to build, train and deploy machine learning model.

4. ### Redis cache limits

It has no limit on storing data on a 64-bit system but, on the 32-bit system, it can only store 3 GB. So, once cache reaches its memory limit, we should remove the old data to make some space for the new one.

Conclusion, in this section we understood what is Redis cache, its capabilities and implementation using Spring-boot data Redis.

5. ### Is Redis just a cache?

Like a cache Redis offers:
- in memory key-value storage

But unlike a cash Redis:
- Supports multiple datatypes (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, and hyperloglogs)
- It provides an ability to store cache data into physical storage (if needed).
- Supports pub-sub model
- Redis cache provides replication for high availability (master/slave)
- Supports ultra-fast lua-scripts. Its execution time equals to C commands execution.
- Can be shared across multiple instances of the application (instead of in-memory cache for each app instance)

6. ### Does Redis persist data?  

Redis supports so-called "snapshots". This means that it will do a complete copy of whats in memory at some points in time (e.g. every full hour). When you lose power between two snapshots, you will lose the data from the time between the last snapshot and the crash (doesn't have to be a power outage..). Redis trades data safety versus performance, like most NoSQL-DBs do.

Redis saves data in one of the following cases:
- automatically from time to time
- when you manually call BGSAVE command
- when redis is shutting down

But data in redis is not really persistent, because:
- crash of redis process means losing all changes since last save
- BGSAVE operation can only be performed if you have enough free RAM (the amount of extra RAM is equal to the size of redis DB)

7. ### What is the advantage of Redis vs using memory?

Redis is a remote data structure server. It is certainly slower than just storing the data in local memory (since it involves socket roundtrips to fetch/store the data). However, it also brings some interesting properties:

    - Redis can be accessed by all the processes of your applications, possibly running on several nodes (something local memory cannot achieve).

    - Redis memory storage is quite efficient, and done in a separate process. If the application runs on a platform whose memory is garbage collected (node.js, java, etc ...), it allows handling a much bigger memory cache/store. In practice, very large heaps do not perform well with garbage collected languages.

    - Redis can persist the data on disk if needed.

    - Redis is a bit more than a simple cache: it provides various data structures, various item eviction policies, blocking queues, pub/sub, atomicity, Lua scripting, etc ...

    - Redis can replicate its activity with a master/slave mechanism in order to implement high-availability.

Basically, if you need your application to scale on several nodes sharing the same data, then something like Redis (or any other remote key/value store) will be required.
